  Tokushoryu had an absolute fairy tale moment in the January 2020 tournament. He entered the tournament as an M17 rank. Literally he was the lowest ranked sumo in a 15 day tournament and he fought his way to the top.

  Link to the match where the image is from with commentary from Jason from Jasonâ€™s All-Sumo channel.

    Important note that he's still in the top division. He's the lowest rank in the top division. So it's still recognised that he's extremely good but even still a huge underdog for the title.

      what does he need to do to become recognized as an updog instead of an underdog?
